# Face recognition controlled highlow card game
This is basic sample of playing High Low Card game using facial expressions (eye blink, wink, smile) and head rotation (lef,right) thanks to Firebase ML Kit sample which provided all neccessary information for making this possible. Firebase ML Kit is easy to set up and play with but it gives you lots of powerfull options that you can use in various situations and projects.

For this project i used facial expression detection (Eyes open/closed, mouth status serious/neutral/happy and head rotation as well). Sample can bi installed from here: https://github.com/cobainmo/face-recognition-highlow-game/tree/master/app/release
